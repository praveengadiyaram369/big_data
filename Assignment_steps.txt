# _Dataset - CO2 Emissions (1994-2004-2014)

1. Import your dataset to Spark.

    (a). Load Main_Data (API_EN.ATM.CO2E.PC_DS2_en_csv_v2_1120909.csv) to Spark dataframe.
    (b). Load Meta_Data (Metadata_Country_API_EN.ATM.CO2E.PC_DS2_en_csv_v2_1120909.csv) to Spark dataframe.

2. Preprocess the data.

    (a). select only "Country Name","Country Code", "1994", "2004", "2014" columns from Main_Data.
    (b). If any of the three columns("1994", "2004", "2014") are missing for a Country, then replace with respective Mean/z-score of that Country.
    (c). Join Meta_Data with Main_Data with Country Code and merge "IncomeGroup" column.

3. Perform some meaningful analysis.

    (a). Calculate the difference in Emissions between 2004 and 1994 to a new column "change_in_emissions".
    (b). Perform clustering on countries with respect to their "change_in_emissions" values.
    (c). Assign each cluster a level of change. (Eg:- 5 clusters - level 1 to level 5).
    (d). Apply clustering(group by) with respect to "IncomeGroup".
    (e). Perform Co-relation analysis among clusters from steps (c) and (d).
    (f). Perform Regression analysis on the data to predict 2014 CO2 Emissions.
    (g). Compare the predicted values against actual values.

4. Present/visualize your results.

    (a). Plot Country wise CO2 Emissions change using GeoPandas.
    (b). Plot year-wise CO2 Emissions for a Country(as a sample).

5. Describe your approach.
