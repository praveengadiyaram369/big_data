# _Dataset - CO2 Emissions (1994-2004-2014)

1. Import your dataset to Spark.

    (a). Load Main_Data (API_EN.ATM.CO2E.PC_DS2_en_csv_v2_1120909.csv) to Spark dataframe.
    (b). Load Meta_Data (Metadata_Country_API_EN.ATM.CO2E.PC_DS2_en_csv_v2_1120909.csv) to Spark dataframe.
    (c). Create a new dataframe (income_df) to store details of IncomeGroup and Income level mapping.

2. Data Pre-processing.

    (a). select only "Country Name","Country Code", "2004", "2014" columns from Main_Data and drop duplicates.
    (b). Filter rows which has null in any columns of "2004" and "2014".
    (c). Add new column "change_in_emissions" which stores the increase/decrease in co2_emission levels in percentage.
    (d). Add new column "change_in_emissions_scaled" which stores the normalized z-score value of the data.
    (d). Join Meta_Data with income_df with IncomeGroup and merge "Incomelevel" column.  
    (e). Join Meta_Data with Main_Data with Country Code and merge "IncomeGroup", "Incomelevel" columns. 
    (f). Filter rows which has null in any columns of "IncomeGroup".    

3. Perform some meaningful analysis.

    (a). Perform k-means clustering on countries with respect to their "change_in_emissions" values.
    (e). Perform Co-relation analysis(+/-) between country's change_in_emissions and their respective IncomeGroup.

4. Present/visualize your results.

    (a). Plot Country wise CO2 Emissions change with GeoPandas.
    (b). Plot Income wise CO2 Emissions change in Scatter plots.

5. Describe your approach.
